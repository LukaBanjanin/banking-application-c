# this project creates a banking application which can read text from the provided input file, make the necessary account changes, and print out a users ending balance

# the program creates accounts, performs various transactions, and updates the balance accordingly which it then prints to an output file

# the assignment PDF indicates all of the specifications that needed to be implemented like what happens when a client goes into overdraft when they have overdraft protection vs when they don't

# the original C program was built for a school project but I have dockerized the application to demonstrate my knowledge of Docker and make it easier to run the application on a windows without the need for a VM

# to build and run the project:
# make sure you have the latest version of docker installed on your machine
# pull the repository from github and cd into the repository folder from powershell or terminal
# type the command "docker build -t bankingapp ."
# type the command "docker run bankingapp"
# the output is printed in the terminal
